# F-word-TA core ��

Because I can't design the proper UI for the main system Yet.

so, I should put the algorithm behind the system here.

I implement with my main Language first (Java) so when I adapt the code to JS it will be easier

remind that I will use the JS as the main tools (without any backend) to implement a `F-word-TA System`
